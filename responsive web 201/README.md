Responsive Web Design 201
=========================

# Key Elements
1. **@media queries -** Allow you to set element attributes based on  device type and browser width. 
2. **font sizing -** No longer should we be using px or pt, welcome to the new world of using em!
3. **images -** Images belong in responsive containers, where we can then set an img tag to max-width.
4. **containers (the responsive grid) -** The responsive grid is a series of containers set to widths corresponding to percentage values.

# Definitions
1. **Responsive Web Design -** A responsive website design starts with the primary task of incorporating CSS3, media queries, the @media rule, and fluid grids that use percentages to create a flexible foundation.[^TR1]
2. **Adaptive Web Design -**  Using a predefined set of layout sizes based on device screen size along with CSS and JavaScript, the AWD approach adapts to the detected device.[^TR1]
